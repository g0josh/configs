In the boot/grub folder of the extracted ISO you should find a file efi.img (there is in Ubuntu 15.04 Minimal ISO). Open it with Disk Image Mounter. You will find here an efi folder which contains a boot folder with bootx64.efi file required for EFI boot. All you have to do is copy the efi folder from here to the root of the extracted ISO (at the same level as boot folder from ISO).
